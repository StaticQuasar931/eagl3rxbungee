## EaglerXBungee Memory Leak Patch

### The latest version of the plugin is EaglerXBungee 1.2.0

**This file does not contain any copyrighted code or registered trademarks of Mojang AB and Microsoft**

This is not software that is built on or is programmed for use within any modified and unmodified Minecraft Java Edition server distro and does not depend on any Mojang AB or Microsoft products to perform it's programmatic functions as advertised

**EULA Disclaimer:** This plugin does not in any rational way violate the EULA as a result of allowing some users to play for free, an ounce of research will reveal EaglerXBungee actually includes a fully developed authentication system to respect the rules and ensure players cannot join a server without a real Minecraft Java Edition account but this system relies on the underlying BungeeCord proxy's authentication to be enabled as well to work correctly. I cannot see in any reasonable way how it's my fault that my plugin allows users to play without authentication if the environment these EULA-violating users have set up to run the plugin within has been modified in ways I (the developer) have no control over. If you [Mojang/Microsoft] don't want people to be able to connect to a BungeeCord proxy and skip authentication and play Minecraft without an account then that's between you and the authors of BungeeCord for them to remove the option from THEIR software's configuration file that allows a server owner to disable the BungeeCord proxy's authentication engine, which by the way, also violates your EULA to the basically the same extent except you can't DMCA it because of PR
